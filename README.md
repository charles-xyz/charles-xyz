### 🙋‍♂️ About Me  
I'm an American Engineer from NYC. I specialize in getting products from 0→1.

I've built everything from LLM-powered evaluation tools for construction bids to personalized training content generators for athletes. I enjoy shipping fast, implementing cutting edge research, and working across the stack.

When I’m not tuning models and building product, you’ll find me skiing 🎿, grappling 🏋️‍♂️, or reading about antiquity.
