### 🙋‍♂️ About Me  
I'm a ML Engineer based in the USA 🇺🇸. I specialize in building AI-powered products from 0→1, I build thoughtfully- trying to find the simplest/ most scalable solution possible.

I've built everything from LLM-powered evaluation tools for construction bids to personalized training content generators for athletes. I enjoy shipping fast, learning deeply, and working across the stack — Python, TypeScript, Terraform, AWS, Docker, Supabase, and more.

When I’m not tuning models and building product, you’ll find me skiing 🎿, lifting 🏋️‍♂️, or reading about antiquity.
